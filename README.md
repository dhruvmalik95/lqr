# lqr

This repo contains all the stuff that I have worked on for research. I have broken it into the following folders:

1. my_theorems: There are two folders in here. correct_proofs contains theorems that I think are correct and directly relevant to current efforts. incorrect_or_not_useful contains a lot of theorems/attempted proofs which either turned out to be wrong or were correct but are not useful.

2. relevant_reading: This contains many of the documents that I have read. It includes core papers directly relevant to our research (ex: Kakade's paper) as well as resources such as EE 227C Notes/Stat 210B chapters.

3. visualizations: This contains visualizations such as the optimization landscape of the LQR or the progress of gradient descent.

4. code: This contains various code files that I have written, such as code for developing visualizations, or implementation of various algorithms. As of now, this is probably the folder that could use some more organization.
