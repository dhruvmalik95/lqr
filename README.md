# lqr

This repo contains all the stuff that I have worked on for research. I have broken it into the following folders:

1. main_paper: This folder has the following subfolders:
	(a) theorem_drafts: This contains the current drafts of the main proofs we will include in the paper.
	(b) paper_draft: This contains the actual paper draft itself.

2. my_theorems: These are all the proof attempts I wrote over the course of this project. Most of them are wrong.

3. relevant_reading: This contains many of the documents that I have read. It includes core papers directly relevant to our research (ex: Kakade's paper) as well as resources such as EE 227C Notes/Stat 210B chapters.

4. visualizations: This contains visualizations such as the optimization landscape of the LQR or the progress of gradient descent.

5. code: This contains various code files that I have written, such as code for developing visualizations, or implementation of various algorithms. As of now, this is probably the folder that could use some more organization.
